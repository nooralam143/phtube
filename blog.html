                <p>JavaScript, a versatile and widely-used programming language, offers various ways to declare variables,
                    such as var, let, and const. Understanding the scope of these declarations is crucial for writing clean,
                    maintainable code. In this blog post, we will explore the scope of var, let, and const and how they
                    affect variable visibility and behavior in your JavaScript programs.</p><br>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">The var Declaration:</h2>
                <p>var is the oldest variable declaration in JavaScript, and it has function-level or global scope. This
                    means that variables declared with var are visible throughout the entire function in which they are
                    defined, or they become global if declared outside of any function.</p><br>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">The let Declaration:</h2>
                <p>let was introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provides block-level scope. This means that variables
                    declared with let are only accessible within the block (enclosed by curly braces {}) in which they are
                    defined.</p><br>
                <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">The const Declaration:</h2>
                <p>lconst, also introduced in ES6, shares block-level scope with let. It is used to declare constants, which
                    cannot be reassigned after they are initially assigned. However, it's important to note that variables
                    declared with const are not entirely immutable if they contain objects or arrays. While the variable
                    itself cannot be reassigned, the properties or elements of the object or array can be modified:</p><br>

                <p>In JavaScript, null and undefined are two distinct primitive values that are often used to represent
                    missing or absent data. They have different use cases and meanings in the language:</p><br>
                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. undefined:</h2>
                <div>
                    <p><b class="font-bold">Default Value:</b> Variables that have been declared but have not been assigned
                        a value are automatically initialized with undefined.</p><br>
                    <!-- <pre class="w-full my-5 bg-black text-white text-left md:w-2/3 lg:w-1/2 xl:w-1/3"><code>

                    console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined

                    <p><b class="font-bold">Function Return:</b>If a function does not explicitly return a value, it returns
                        undefined by default.</p><br>

                        function doSomething() {}
                        console.log(doSomething()); // Outputs: undefined                    
                        </code></pre> -->
                    <p><b class="font-bold">Property Access:</b>When you try to access an object property that doesn't
                        exist, JavaScript returns undefined.</p><br>

                        <p><b class="font-bold">Explicit Absence:</b>Unlike undefined, null is a value that you can
                            explicitly set to indicate the absence of a value or an empty state. It is often used to
                            represent intentional or explicit non-existence.</p><br>

                            to indicate that they did not find a valid result or object. For example, the getElementById
                            method returns null if no element with the specified ID is found</p><br>

                <h1 class="text-2xl font-extrabold">What do you mean by REST API?</h1>
                <p>REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style and a set of
                    constraints for designing networked applications. A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is
                    an API that follows the principles and constraints of REST.
                    <br>
                    Here are the key concepts and principles of REST:
                </p><br>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Resources:</strong> In REST, everything is considered a resource. Resources are identified by URLs (Uniform
                        Resource Locators) and can be anything, such as data objects, services, or entities like users,
                        products, or articles.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>HTTP Methods:</strong> RESTful APIs use HTTP methods (verbs) to perform actions on resources. The most common
                        HTTP methods used in RESTful APIs are:
                        <br>
                        GET: Retrieve data from the server.<br>
                        POST: Create a new resource on the server.<br>
                        PUT: Update an existing resource or create a new resource if it doesn't exist.<br>
                        PATCH: Partially update an existing resource.<br>
                        DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
                    </li><br>
                    <li><strong>Stateless:</strong> Each HTTP request from a client to a server must contain all the
                        information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any client state
                        between requests. This means that every request from a client to a server must include all the
                        necessary information, including authentication credentials if required.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Uniform Interface:</strong> REST APIs have a consistent and uniform interface, which
                        simplifies interactions. The uniform interface typically includes using standard HTTP methods and
                        following common conventions for resource URLs and response formats.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Resource Representation:</strong> Resources in REST are represented in a specific format,
                        such as JSON or XML. Clients can request different representations of the same resource, like JSON
                        or XML, using the Accept header.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Stateless Communication:</strong> REST APIs do not maintain state on the server between
                        requests. Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed for the
                        server to understand and fulfill the request.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Layered System:</strong> REST allows for the use of a layered system architecture where
                        multiple components (e.g., load balancers, caches, and servers) can work together to provide a
                        scalable and flexible system.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Client-Server:</strong> REST separates the client from the server. Clients are responsible
                        for the user interface and user experience, while servers are responsible for storing and managing
                        resources.</li><br>
                    <li><strong>Cacheability:</strong> Responses from the server can be explicitly marked as cacheable or
                        non-cacheable, which helps improve performance by reducing the need for repeated requests.</li>
                </ol>
